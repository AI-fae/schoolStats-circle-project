## Altschool Holiday Challenge


SchoolStat is A simple dashboard for a tech school


## About the project

This is a group challenge to practice javascript, html and css skills

Scenerio:

You have data about which instructors are taking the courses in a school, as well as data about which students are in the frontend, backend or cloud tracks. Your users need to see some basic stats about the school

Outcome:
When the user opens your dashboard app, they see HTML tables showing the following statistics/summaries
How many courses a given instructor is taking
How many students are in each of the tracks (frontend, backend and cloud)
How many students are male, female or other genders/orientation
Minimum, maximum, and average age of students in the school

Advanced features (OPTIONAL- build any, some or all if you feel up to it)
Make the tables sortable by (at least) the column holding the numbers. Indicate what columns are sortable (e.g with an icon or by adding the <> characters in the column header e.t.c). When the user clicks on a sortable column header, sort the records in the table by that column (e.g switch the current sort order such that if the column was already sorted ASC, sort in DESC)
